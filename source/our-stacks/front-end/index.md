# Front-end

Front-end development at Nodes builds a variety of products using modern web technologies.

We build web apps, hybrid apps, websites using [Angular](https://www.angular.io) or [Ionic](https://www.ionicframework.com) for both our clients and for internal use, as well as the occasional email layouts. 

### Tasks
 - Writing and maintaining UI libraries for client and internal use
 - Building responsive layouts for a range of modern browsers
 - Writing business and view logic
 - Integrating with in-house or external APIs and services 
 - Work closely with our UX and Design teams

### Languages

##### JavaScript
Most of our code is currently written in ES5, but we are looking to switch to TypeScript and ES6+. We write JavaScript both for the browsers and for our toolchains (using NodeJS).

##### CSS
All of our styling is written in Sass (scss), where we make use of the BEM syntax and SMACCS principles to keep our CSS well structured, flexible and object-oriented.

##### HTML/Templates
HTML is a given but we also use the blade templating language when working on PHP projects, and EJS/Handlebars for internal sites and email layouts.
